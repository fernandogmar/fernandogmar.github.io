I wanted to start my own blog for a long time ago. I am not a native English speaker so this is a kind of new challenge for improving my English. Please, bear with me :D

Recently I found this post [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) written by [Barry Clark](http://www.barryclark.co/about/). It was really easy to follow so this is my first post :D. 

For this first post I used the editor [prose.io](https://prose.io) really simple to use ;)
